Simulcasting\r\nWhen you are streaming live on the Twitch Services you may not simultaneously live stream or broadcast (“Simulcast”) on any other “Twitch-like Service,” meaning any web-based network, platform, or service that supports live streaming of user generated content, without advance written permission from Twitch. For clarity, you may Simulcast on mobile-first services that support live streaming. This Section does not apply to non-profit or government entities that are live streaming for non-commercial purposes.\r\n12. Advertisements",

However, malicious individuals often leverage a number of tactics to try and confuse these systems. While our automated detection catches a significant amount of this abuse, we also leverage account suspensions and resets to deal with names that do manage to evade or pre-date our filtering system.\r\nProhibited Games\r\nIn order to ensure that the content broadcast on Twitch abides by our Community Guidelines and is appropriate for a diverse audience, we prohibit games that contain developer-generated content that is clearly violative, as well as social platform games frequently used for unmitigated abuse. Broadcasting or showcasing content from these games will lead to enforcement action against your account. \r\nUsing the mature content flag, setting the broadcast or VOD to a different title, setting the stream to subscribers only, or categorizing the stream under ‘Not Playing’ does not constitute an exemption from this policy. Games are prohibited from being streamed if they have an Adults Only (AO) rating from the ESRB, or if they contain content that violates our community guidelines. Please see our Prohibited Games article for more information. \r\nProhibited Gambling Content\r\nWe do not allow users to share links or affiliate codes to sites that contain slots, roulette, or dice games.\r\n  For example, on Twitch you may not:\r\n• Share a referral code to a slots site with your chat\r\n• Include a banner with a link to online roulette games\r\n• Verbally refer your chat to a site containing dice games",

Will my account be suspended?\r\n\r\nAs owner of your account, it�s entirely your responsibility to ensure that anything shared on your account abides by Twitch�s Terms of Service (ToS) and Community Guidelines (CG). If you are unsure if a link, photo, video, or other content in your broadcast breaks these, we suggest that you review it privately before airing it on your broadcast. Content that breaks ToS or CG, whether shown accidentally or on purpose, can be reported and moderation may take appropriate action on that content, including removing the content and issuing on a suspension on your account. Given the nature of live content, we expect you to take proper precautions; even one incident may warrant action.\r\nWhy aren�t there specific rules about what clothing is and isn�t allowed on Twitch?\r\n\r\nAs Twitch continues to expand the variety of content we feature, so comes the need for updating the range of attire that is acceptable. For example, something that is acceptable for a broadcast at the beach or the gym may not be acceptable for a cooking or gameplay broadcast. In an effort to help creators abide by our Community Guidelines in the same way they would expectations of behavior in the real world, we�ve updated our policies to reflect that we will consider not just the attire itself, but also the contextual setting in which it is worn and the intent of the person wearing it, when moderating content. Please remember that sexually explicit or suggestive content, such as nudity exposing or focusing on genitals, buttocks, or nipples, and attire intended to be sexually suggestive are prohibited.\r\nWhat about subscriber emotes?",
