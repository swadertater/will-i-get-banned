  "text": "As an AI, I can tell you that Twitch's Community Guidelines strictly prohibit hate speech, symbols, or conduct. Even though the Finnish swastika is culturally meaningful and has a historic context different from the version adopted by the Nazi regime, it's widely seen as a symbol of hate due to its association with the Nazi party. Given the potential for misunderstanding or misinterpretation, it's safest to avoid using such symbols to ensure your content aligns with Twitch's standards aimed at maintaining a safe and inclusive community.",

Will my account be suspended?\r\nAs owner of your account, it’s entirely your responsibility to ensure that anything shared on your account abides by Twitch’s Terms of Service (ToS) and Community Guidelines (CG). If you are unsure if a link, photo, video, or other content in your broadcast breaks these, we suggest that you review it privately before airing it on your broadcast. Content that breaks ToS or CG, whether shown accidentally or on purpose, can be reported and moderation may take appropriate action on that content, including removing the content and issuing a suspension on your account. Given the nature of live content, we expect you to take proper precautions; even one incident may warrant action.\r\nIf viewers mass report my channel for sexual content, can I be suspended even if I did nothing wrong?\r\nNo, frivolous report brigading will never result in a channel being suspended. All of our sexual content enforcements are manually reviewed and issued. If you feel that a suspension has been issued in error, you may file an appeal, the instructions for which can be found on our Account Enforcements help article . All Community Guidelines suspension notifications also contain a link to this article.\r\nAre there restrictions against nudity and sexual content in emotes, badges, and cheermotes?",

If you are unsure if a link, photo, video, or other content in your broadcast breaks these, we suggest that you review it privately before airing it on your broadcast.

Given the nature of live content, we expect you to take proper precautions; even one incident may warrant action.\r\nWhy aren�t there specific rules about what clothing is and isn�t allowed on Twitch?\r\n\r\nAs Twitch continues to expand the variety of content we feature, so comes the need for updating the range of attire that is acceptable. For example, something that is acceptable for a broadcast at the beach or the gym may not be acceptable for a cooking or gameplay broadcast. In an effort to help creators abide by our Community Guidelines in the same way they would expectations of behavior in the real world, we�ve updated our policies to reflect that we will consider not just the attire itself, but also the contextual setting in which it is worn and the intent of the person wearing it, when moderating content. Please remember that sexually explicit or suggestive content, such as nudity exposing or focusing on genitals, buttocks, or nipples, and attire intended to be sexually suggestive are prohibited.\r\nWhat about subscriber emotes?",

      "pageContent": "Be cognizant of others—some people only recognize or enjoy banter when they have an established relationship with the other person. If someone asks you to stop or indicates that your conduct is unwanted, such as through a channel timeout, continuing to target them after that point will be seen as a deliberate attempt to harass. If a discussion becomes heated and goes beyond friendly banter, consider removing yourself from the conversation to prevent the situation from escalating further. Additionally, some topics are generally not viewed as acceptable banter by the community, such as sending sexual solicitations or encouraging others to harm themselves. You should not engage in these behaviors, and doing so will jeopardize your Twitch account. \r\nCan I be suspended for sexually suggestive conversations even if I do not intend to harass anyone?\r\nOur guidelines on sexual harassment do not apply in conversations where there is clear, mutual consent. However, even if both parties clearly have an established relationship, we will issue an enforcement if we obtain any indication from the target that sexually harassing statements made on Twitch are unwanted, or if mutual consent is not explicitly clear. A person’s physical appearance or attire is not an indication of solicitation or consent. Additionally, please note that sexual commentary that is graphic or extended, even if not in violation of our sexual harassment policy, is still subject to our sexually suggestive content policy.\r\nCan I be suspended for hateful or harassing content that viewers put on my stream?",
