Any content or activity that disrupts, interrupts, harms, or otherwise violates the integrity of Twitch services or another user’s experience or devices is prohibited. \r\n  For example, you may not:\r\n• Post spam, such as large amounts of repetitive, unwanted messages or user reports\r\n• Distribute unauthorized advertisements\r\n• Engage in phishing, spreading malware, or viruses\r\n• Defraud Twitch or others\r\n• Engage in viewership tampering (such as artificially inflating follow or live viewer stats)\r\n• Sell or sharing user accounts, services, or features\r\n• Cheat the Twitch rewards system (such as the Drops or channel points systems)\r\n• Engage in any cheating, hacking, botting, or tampering, that gives the account owner an unfair advantage in an online multiplayer game\r\nWe understand that sometimes streamers are victims of account takeover, fraud, or viewbotting directed by a malicious third party. We have methods to detect the responsible party and do not penalize good-faith streamers under these circumstances.\r\nSuspension Evasion\r\nCircumventing our enforcement actions undermines the integrity of our service. Any attempt to circumvent an account suspension or chat ban by using other accounts, identities, or by appearing on another user’s account will also result in an additional enforcement against your accounts, up to an indefinite suspension. Similarly, you may not use your channel to knowingly feature or advertise a suspended user. \r\n  For example, you may not:\r\n• Create a new account in order to evade a suspension issued to your primary account\r\n• Facilitate a suspended user on your own channel, either by restreaming their content or hosting them directly",

Will my account be suspended?\r\n\r\nAs owner of your account, it�s entirely your responsibility to ensure that anything shared on your account abides by Twitch�s Terms of Service (ToS) and Community Guidelines (CG). If you are unsure if a link, photo, video, or other content in your broadcast breaks these, we suggest that you review it privately before airing it on your broadcast. Content that breaks ToS or CG, whether shown accidentally or on purpose, can be reported and moderation may take appropriate action on that content, including removing the content and issuing on a suspension on your account. Given the nature of live content, we expect you to take proper precautions; even one incident may warrant action.\r\nWhy aren�t there specific rules about what clothing is and isn�t allowed on Twitch?\r\n\r\nAs Twitch continues to expand the variety of content we feature, so comes the need for updating the range of attire that is acceptable. For example, something that is acceptable for a broadcast at the beach or the gym may not be acceptable for a cooking or gameplay broadcast. In an effort to help creators abide by our Community Guidelines in the same way they would expectations of behavior in the real world, we�ve updated our policies to reflect that we will consider not just the attire itself, but also the contextual setting in which it is worn and the intent of the person wearing it, when moderating content. Please remember that sexually explicit or suggestive content, such as nudity exposing or focusing on genitals, buttocks, or nipples, and attire intended to be sexually suggestive are prohibited.\r\nWhat about subscriber emotes?",
